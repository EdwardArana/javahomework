This page was made to generate a random password, When you click on the generate password button the page will prompt the user to pick a password length between 8 and 128.
Once this step is complete there will be 3 more prompts of questions asking the user if they would like Upper case letters, Lower case letters, Numbers, and special symbols.
Once these steps are completed the website will generate a random sting. This will change depending on the password length and what characters you want in your password.
        
                                                                            * How the code works *

What I did with the code here was I made serval different variables that were equal to an Array of numbers, letters, and special symbols. Once this step was done I made my prompts to ensure the user gets the desired password. These prompts are true or false statements (boolean). So when the user doesnt want numbers or letters for example. The code will remove that using ( IF, Else If) statements. Once this step is over the code will select randomly from each array and make your password. With this I used a for loop and to help me go through each array making it faster for the coder. After this the password is shown on the screen.
